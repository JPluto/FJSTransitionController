FJSKeyedViewController

This class allows you to load arbitrary view controllers and animate transistions between the views.

It is a FULL replacement for UINavigationController and/or UItabBarController.

It currently supports 5 types of animations provided by the excellent FTUtils

It provides your VCs all proper viewDid/WillAppear and viewDid/WillDisapear messages WITH proper timing
This was particularly important to me since the few other classes that do something similar send all these messages on the same runloop, which is NOT how UINC and UITC send these updates.



It depends on 2 other open source projects: FTUtils, and SDNextRunLoopProxy

FTUtils is added as a git submodule, to add it to this project do the following in the Terminal:

git submodule init
git submodule update

Then you will be able to compile. (You can also just download the source directly)

This project is still very much beta (as of mid-Mar 2010), but I am developing it for use in 2 other projects. So expect it to become production ready sooner than later.
